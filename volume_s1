volume_s1

Format the volume: First time only
WARNING: This step will destroy all existing data on the volume. Only run this command on a new volume or if you're sure you want to destroy the existing data.

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0DO_Volume_volume-s1

Mount the volume
Run the following commands on the Droplet to make your volume accessible:

# Create a mount point for your volume:
$ mkdir -p /mnt/volume_s1

# Mount your volume at the newly-created mount point:
$ mount -o discard,defaults,noatime /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0DO_Volume_volume-s1 /mnt/volume_s1

# Change fstab so the volume will be mounted after a reboot
$ echo '/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0DO_Volume_volume-s1 /mnt/volume_s1 ext4 defaults,nofail,discard 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
Copy
Access the volume, write files, and store other data on the volume in the Droplet's /mnt/volume_s1 directory. The data will persist if you detach the volume and will be available when the volume is reattached to another Droplet.
